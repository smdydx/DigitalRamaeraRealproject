            {[
              {
                question: "What is a dApp?",
                answer: "A dApp (decentralized application) is a software application that runs on a distributed computing system - typically blockchain networks. Unlike traditional apps, dApps operate on peer-to-peer networks without central authorities, offering enhanced security, transparency, and user control. They commonly integrate with digital wallets and smart contracts to provide trustless interactions and automated functionality."
              },
              {
                question: "How long does it take to develop a dApp?",
                answer: "The development timeline for a dApp typically ranges from 2-6 months, depending on complexity. A basic dApp might take 2-3 months, while complex platforms with multiple smart contracts and advanced features could take 4-6 months or more. Factors affecting timeline include: blockchain platform selection, smart contract complexity, UI/UX requirements, integration needs, and testing/auditing processes."
              },
              {
                question: "Which blockchains do you support?",
                answer: "We provide comprehensive development services across multiple blockchain platforms including: Ethereum (most popular for dApps and DeFi), Binance Smart Chain (high performance, low fees), Polygon (scalable Ethereum sidechain), Solana (high-speed, low-cost transactions), Avalanche (fast finality, subnet support), and other EVM-compatible chains. We help choose the best platform based on your specific needs for speed, cost, and security."
              },
              {
                question: "Do you provide smart contract auditing?",
                answer: "Yes, we offer comprehensive smart contract auditing services as part of our dApp development process. Our audit includes: automated vulnerability scanning, manual code review, gas optimization analysis, business logic verification, security best practices assessment, and formal verification for critical contracts. We partner with leading audit firms for additional security assurance on high-value contracts."
              },
              {
                question: "How much does it cost to build a dApp?",
                answer: "dApp development costs vary based on several factors: project complexity (simple dApp: $20,000-50,000, complex platform: $50,000-200,000+), features required (smart contracts, user interface, integrations), blockchain platform chosen (gas fees, deployment costs), team size and expertise needed, and ongoing maintenance requirements. We provide detailed cost breakdowns during consultation and offer flexible engagement models to suit different budgets."
